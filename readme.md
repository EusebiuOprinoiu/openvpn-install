# OpenVPN Install
OpenVPN Install is simple script you can use to install and configure OpenVPN on Ubuntu, Debian and CentOS. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

The script is a fork of the [openvpn-install](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install) script created and maintained by [Nyr](https://github.com/Nyr). This version uses a different class of IPs and it provides different DNS resolvers than the original.

## Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget http://eusb.me/29twi0P -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.

## I want to run my own VPN but I don't have a server

You can get a great VPS for just $5/month at [Digital Ocean](https://eusebiu.me/digitalocean).
